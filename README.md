Introduction
Transportation in any learning institution is important for both learners and educators and has to be done with care and efficiency in mind. Generally, managing the transport of an institution of higher learning through traditional approaches tends to rigidly misinterpret safety issues, incur delays, and have communication gaps. To solve these problems, the overall transportation phenomena within the fences of a college campus gets easier with the help of an app called AcademiGo.

Objectives
The primary goals of the AcademiGo app include the following: 

	Real-Time Bus Tracking: Providing students and staff with the s ability to track the location of college buses, thus minimizing waiting periods, doubts, and uncertainties.  

	Enhanced Safety Features: Guaranteeing safe passage of passengers through SOS alerts and constant monitoring.  

	Digitized Processes: Ensuring that bus passes and attendance registration are processed automatically without manual involvement.  

	Route Optimization: Achieving the efficient bus service allocation with dynamic re-distribution of serviced bus stops under real time demand changes.  

Problem Statement
Manual management of intercampus transportation services is outdated and ineffective. Continuously recurring problems such as undesired delays, ineffective communication, and lapses in safety provide for a need to design an optimized solution which will maximize the efficient use of technology and safety measures.
App's Major Highlights
	Live Location Access: With the ability to view almost real-time bus locations, students and staff can manage their arrival timings for bus stops better.

	Instant SOS Dispatch: Authorities can receive alerts for emergencies which enables passenger notifications to be sent instantly requiring a prompt response.

	Bus Pass Digitalization: The incorporation of digital passes eliminates the need for physical card storage and accelerates the boarding process.

	Attendance Capture: Attendance is captured when the passengers are boarding and alighting from the bus, hence no manual effort is required for record keeping.

	Real-time Route Changing: Availing and departing on time is guaranteed because routes can be changed after considering passenger numbers and side traffic.

Approach
AcademiGo was developed after looking into the transportation related issues faced in various college campuses. Existing problems of students and staff were captured through surveys. The design and features were developed considering this data, ensuring the problem was solved effectively.

Predicted Impacts
The anticipated impacts of AcademiGo include the following: 

	Overtime cuts due to buses not needing estimation of arrival.

	Safety improvement due to constant monitoring of students and prompt emergency action.

	Reduction of workload from manual processes like attendance taking and pass checking.
Analysis From the Survey Data
To Understand the present level of college transport, a survey was performed among students and staff to gather their views. The key findings are as follows: 

	Mode of Public Transport: A handful of students walk to college, while a relatively smaller percentage of them use the school transport services. 

	Satisfaction Levels: With the majority of the surveyed commuters, satisfaction for the public transport system were on the lower side for reasons which included chaos in the buses, delayed services, and unsatisfactory maintenance. 

	Safety Concerns: Students remain particularly concerned about safety while using transit and this calls for enhanced security measures in college transportation.
